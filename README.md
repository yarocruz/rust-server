# Rust Server

Following the final project from [the Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html). For JS folks, it's like building a Web Server with Node without Express. Kinda. But I'd say it's even a bit lower level since you are working more directly with the TCP protocol.

It's a very barebones server that makes me appreciate the libraries and frameworks that have standardized and abstracted away many things that you have to keep rewriting from scratch. 

I'm also playing around with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).
